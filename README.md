## What is the Pomodoro Technique?

The Pomodoro Technique, developed by Francesco Cirillo, is a time management method that divides work into short, focused intervals of 25 minutes (called *Pomodoros*) separated by 5-minute breaks.  
This approach enhances concentration, reduces fatigue, and maintains consistent productivity.
