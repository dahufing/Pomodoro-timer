# Pomodoro-timer⏱️
A simple Pomodoro timer built with Electron. It features three buttons (Start, Work, Break) to manage study and rest cycles. Each work session lasts 25 minutes, followed by a 5‑minute break. This project is my first experience with app/web design, and it includes hand‑drawn illustrations created personally.
